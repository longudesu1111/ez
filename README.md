### Creating an application!
1) Head to https://discord.com/developers/applications and log in!
2) Click the "New Application" button on the top right!
3) Enter a name for your application and click "Create"!
4) Navigate to your application and click the "Bot" tab on the left.
5) Click the "Add Bot" option on the right and click "Yes, do it!"
6) After your bot has been created, click the "Reset Token" button. Enter your 2FA code if it prompts you for one.
7) Your bot's token should be displayed! Copy and paste it somewhere and keep it secret!
### Running the bot!
1) Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/!
2) Once Node.js is installed, download the repository by pressing "Download ZIP". Once the file is downloaded, unzip the file!

3) After the file is unzipped, open the folder. Once you are inside and can see the files `index.js` and `package.json`, type `cmd` in the top bar which shows your directory!
4) After the command prompt is open, type `npm install` and press enter!
5) Once the libraries are finished installing and you can type again, type `token=Insert your token here node .` and press enter. This will run the bot and you will see a ping slash command! Run it, and you should get 'Pong!' as a response!
6) Once you recieve the response, you can close the command prompt.
### Recieving the badge!
1) After running the command and recieving the response, you may have to wait up to 24 hours.
2) You can check https://discord.com/developers/active-developer to check your status. If it says "You are not eligible", keep on waiting!
3) Please note that you may need a *community server* to select on the active developer page in order to recieve the badge!

### Wait, is this allowed?
Here is an official statement from Ian (Desch),
> We have received a lot of questions about why the badge isn't restricted to verified bots, or bots in X amount of servers, or something to make the badge more difficult to obtain. A lot of users seem worried the badge is too easy to get, or that people will download a bot from GitHub just to get the badge.

> For the record - getting the badge this way is valid and should be encouraged! Everyone starts learning programming in different ways. We should not judge people for how they start bot development, we should instead welcome them into our community and encourage them to continue learning however they want

> They will have learned about creating a bot on discord, they will have learned how to get a bot online and run a program, and will have learned about configuring that bot. Their intent to get the badge doesn't disqualify the learning that happened, and we should help them continue their journey as new developers.

> This badge is meant to be for everyone and we want it to be easy to obtain! If someone uses it to learn about programming and bot development, then it is has been a resounding success ðŸ™‚

That being said, if you want to continue developing with developing a bot, check out these awesome libraries and resources!
